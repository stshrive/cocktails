# The Black Tie Negroni - by Steven Shriver

Averna has this version of the classic cocktail throwing on a "black tie" and
is perfect for someone looking for that classic Negroni taste with some added
complexity.

I dial back some of the bitterness of the classic Negroni by pulling out some
of the Campari and substituting for Averna which is a touch sweeter and has an
additional depth of flavor that Campari alone cannot provide. I also substitute
the use of vermouth with Quinquina/Chinato which comes along whith its own
bitterness, something fans of the Gin and Tonic may recognize, quinine.

## Recipe

### Ingredients

- [ ] `1/1` Part Hendrick's Gin
- [ ] `3/4` Part Campari
- [ ] `3/4` Part Averna Amaro
- [ ] `1/2` Part Bonal Gentiane-Quina

- [ ] `2 dashes` of Angostura Orange Bitters
- [ ] Orange Peel

- [ ] `1 Large` Ice Cube for mixing
- [ ] \(Optional\) `1 Large` Ice Cube if serving on the Rocks

### Instructions

#### Equipment

- [ ] `1` Stirring Spoon
- [ ] `1` Mixing Glass
- [ ] `1` Cocktail Strainer
- [ ] `1 chilled` serving glass of choice (Rocks OR Nick & Nora)

#### Preparation

Add all liquid ingredients, except bitters to a mixing glass along with a
large ice cube (at least `2in`) and stir until well chilled.

#### Presentation

- Serve [OR]
  - _up_ in a Nick & Nora
  - _on the rocks_ over one large ice cube in a rocks glass
- top with the 2 dashes of bitters
- Express oils from orange peel over glass and add the peel to the cocktail as
  a garnish.

## Notes

- `1 part` is generally equal to `1oz`
- To batch the cocktail, add `3/4` part of water to the liquid ingredients
  and multiply all ingredients (except bitters) by the number of serving
  desired. For example, assuming 15 servings:
  ```
  S = 15
  15 Parts Gin
  10 1/4 Parts Campari
  10 1/4 Parts Averna
   7 1/2 Parts Bonal Quinquina
  10 1/4 Parts Water
  ```

  Chill entire mixture in bottle and follow desired presentation as normal
